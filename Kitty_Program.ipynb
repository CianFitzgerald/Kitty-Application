    "# Assignment One - Kitty (Revised Solution)\n",
    "\n",
    "For this assignment I have decided to approach the problem by creating two classes, these being: member and event. The member class takes in each members name and initialises their balance and contribution at zero. And the event class keeps track of the event that occured, the transactions that took place, the total cost of the transactions, and the reconciliation for each member. "
